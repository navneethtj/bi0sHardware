### Bare Metal Programming

#### Description :
So, I've been working on this project to control pins on an ATmega328P microcontroller using Arduino-compatible code. It hasn't been all smooth sailing. I started by trying to simulate an Arduino code , but things just didn't click despite diving into low-level programming tutorials. No matter how many times I checked the circuit and code, it just wouldn't behave as expected. Then, I rewrote the code using simpler Arduino functions like `pinMode` and `digitalWrite`. And the circuit started working. 
This whole experience taught me a couple of valuable lessons. First off, understanding different programming levels is crucial; sometimes, starting with simpler tools can save you a ton of headache. Secondly, troubleshooting is more than just a step â€”it's a journey. In the end, through a mix of trial and error, I managed to tame those ATmega328P pins and get the project humming along just right.
