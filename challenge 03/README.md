This Arduino project showcases serial data transmission between two Arduinos using UART communication. One Arduino acts as the sender, continuously sending numbers from 0 to infinity with a 1-second delay between transmissions. The other Arduino serves as the receiver, displaying the received data on a 16x2 LCD screen. The project includes a circuit diagram detailing the connections between the Arduinos, serial communication modules, and the LCD display. By uploading specific codes to each Arduino and ensuring proper connections, users can observe the seamless transfer of data from sender to receiver. Exploring this project provided insights into UART communication and serial protocols, while referencing online resources for circuit setup and programming logic.
