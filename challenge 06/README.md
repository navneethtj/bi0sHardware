I created an online simulation to operate a 16x2 LCD using switches, displaying "bi0sHardware" on the screen. To accomplish this, I first familiarized myself with LCD operation through various materials. The YouTube video provided a clear explanation, which helped me in understanding the process. Initially, I attempted to implement the simulation on Wokwi but encountered connectivity issues. Switching to Tinkercad resolved these problems, allowing me to successfully simulate the LCD display using switches.
