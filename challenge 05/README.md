I created a Caesar Cipher decoder simulation implemented using an Arduino board. Through serial communication, encoded data is transmitted to the Arduino for decryption, utilizing a shift value of 3. I started with reading about Caesar Cipher, followed by the development of code for serial communication and the decoding algorithm. Overcoming initial hurdles in algorithm design, I performed many testing and debugging to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the decoding process. Reflecting on this process, I found it both enjoyable and educational, showcasing my understanding of ciphers, algorithm design, and Arduino programming skills.
