## Arduino Keypad Lock with OLED Display

This project integrates an Arduino, a keypad, an OLED display, and a servo motor to create a secure lock system. Users input an 8-digit PIN on the keypad, triggering the servo to turn if the PIN matches. The OLED screen displays the door status. The system resets the servo after 5 seconds.

**Challenges and Learning**

Learning to use the OLED display and keypad from scratch was challenging but achievable with YouTube tutorials and online documantations. While encryption for the PIN storage wasn't implemented due to complexity, the project functions as intended with plaintext storage. Future iterations could focus on adding encryption for PIN security and refining user feedback on the OLED display. Despite limitations, this project demonstrates practical Arduino-based security applications.
