## Traffic Light Control System using Ladder Logic Programming

This was a new type of programming for me. I had to start from scratch. I used the resorces provided to teach myself some concepts related to PLC programming. For simplicity I used an online simulator instead of OpenPLC. I started to create some small programs to test my understanding of different components. With that knowledge, I was able to build a logic for the traffic light controlling system. After some testing and debugging, the program worked. This project gave me exposure to PLC programming.
